# simple-js-app

The objective of this project was to build a Pokedex using the pokeapi [Link](https://pokeapi.co/).

The first 150 Pokemon are pulled in using fetch API and arranged in a grid.

Majority of styles are done using Bootstrap.

Resize the browser window to see how the Navbar changes format when reaching the appropriate threshold.

Resize the browswer window to see how the pokedex grid resizes and repositions for narrower screens.

Hover over a pokemon to see animation and color change.

Click on a pokemon to see modal display details about that pokemon.

Click the "X", outside of the modal, or press the escape key to close the modal.

The Pokedex Sarch and Navbar links do not work at this time.
